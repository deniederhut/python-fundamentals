# Sometimes you want to avoid side effects (like print statements), you just
# want to get the values computed by a function and have complete control. In
# this case, we can move our print statements to one of those if __name__ ...
# blocks

# That's a nice way to have a quick way to run your script and see that it does
# something sensible, but allow those functions to be used by others
